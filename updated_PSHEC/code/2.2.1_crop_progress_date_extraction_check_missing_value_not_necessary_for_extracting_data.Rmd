2. Extract the week starting date of at least 50% planted or matured 

```{r median_date}

library(lubridate)

# combine two datasets
crop <- rbind.data.frame(group1,group2)

# convert character to date
crop$week_ending <- as.Date(crop$week_ending)

corn_prog <- crop %>%
  mutate(week_start = floor_date(week_ending, unit = 'week', week_start = 1)) %>%
  group_by(commodity_desc,year,state_alpha,unit_desc) %>%
  filter(crop_progress_pct >= 50) %>%
  slice_min(week_start) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(yday = yday(week_start)) %>%
  select(commodity_desc,year, state_alpha,unit_desc,begin_code,yday,week_start,crop_progress_pct)

```

3. Check for missing values

```{r missing}
# add week start
#corn_prog$week_start <- as.Date(corn_prog$week_start)

corn_prog_wide <- corn_prog %>% 
  select(-c(begin_code,crop_progress_pct,week_start)) %>%

  mutate(

      TRUE ~ "PCT MATURE")
  ) %>%

  rename(pct_planted = `PCT PLANTED`) %>%
  rename(pct_mature = `PCT MATURE`) %>%
  mutate(diff = case_when(pct_planted > pct_mature ~ 'check',
                          TRUE ~ 'other'))

# read the county list
crop_counties <- read.csv(file = 'data/nass_processed_yield/all_10_crops_county_list_2000_2023.csv')
# Ensure the 'GEOID' column is a string with 5 characters, left-padded with zeros
crop_counties$GEOID <- formatC(crop_counties$GEOID, width = 5, format = 'd' ,flag = '0')

crop_counties_long <- crop_counties %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = 'crop', values_to = 'value', cols = c(BARLEY:WHEAT)) %>%
  filter(value == 1) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(GEOID, value)) %>%

# filter crop and states that have yield data

    TRUE ~ 1
  ))

4. to fix the missing value. 

Corn, Barley, and oats

```{r data}
# Specify the range of years across which you want to collect data

## Crop Progress

# group I: can be extracted by plant and mature  
barley_oat <- plyr::ldply(years, function(x){
  
  params <- list(
    commodity_desc =
      c("BARLEY","OATS"),
    year = x,
    agg_level_desc = "STATE", 
    source_desc = "SURVEY",  # change source to source_desc
    #domain_desc = "TOTAL",
    statisticcat_desc = 'PROGRESS',
    unit_desc = c("PCT MATURE", "PCT HARVESTED") # this description might be different for different crops
  )
  
  return(
    nassqs(params) %>%

corn <- plyr::ldply(years, function(x){

          grepl("CORN, GRAIN - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED", short_desc)
  )
```

2. Extract the week starting date of harvest and mature 

```{r median_date}
#1) calculate the starting date of the week (week starts on Monday)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)

# convert character to date
barley_oat$begin_code <- as.numeric(barley_oat$begin_code)

barley_oat_prog <- barley_oat %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(short_desc,state_ansi,reference_period_desc,week_ending)) %>%
  group_by(commodity_desc,state_alpha,year) %>%
  mutate(rel_begin_code = begin_code - min(begin_code)+1)

# barley 
barley_prog <- barley_oat_prog %>% 
  filter(commodity_desc == 'BARLEY')

ggplot(data = barley_prog) +
  geom_point(aes(x = rel_begin_code, y = crop_progress_pct, color = unit_desc)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = rel_begin_code, y = crop_progress_pct, color = unit_desc), method = 'loess') +
  facet_wrap(~state_alpha) +
  labs(title = 'Barley')

# Oats
oat_prog <- barley_oat_prog %>% 
  filter(commodity_desc == 'OATS')

ggplot(data = oat_prog) +
  geom_point(aes(x = rel_begin_code, y = crop_progress_pct, color = unit_desc)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = rel_begin_code, y = crop_progress_pct, color = unit_desc), method = 'loess') +
  facet_wrap(~state_alpha) +
  labs(title = 'Oats')

# corn
# convert character to date
corn$begin_code <- as.numeric(corn$begin_code)

corn_prog <- corn %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(short_desc,state_ansi,reference_period_desc,week_ending)) %>%
  group_by(commodity_desc,state_alpha,year) %>%
  mutate(rel_begin_code = begin_code - min(begin_code)+1)

ggplot(data = corn_prog) +
  geom_point(aes(x = rel_begin_code, y = crop_progress_pct, color = unit_desc)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = rel_begin_code, y = crop_progress_pct, color = unit_desc), method = 'loess') +
  facet_wrap(~state_alpha) +
  labs(title = 'Corn')

```

Results: A few states are missing the mature dates, but have harvest dates for barley and oats

For barley and oats: when extracting the mature dates, >50% of mature is usually overlaps with 25% harvest. So will use >= 25% harvest date for mature dates

For corn: when extracting the mature dates, >50% of mature is usually overlaps with 5~10% harvest. So will use >= 7.5% harvest date for mature dates
