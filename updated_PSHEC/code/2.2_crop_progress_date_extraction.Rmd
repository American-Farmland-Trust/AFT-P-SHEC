# Pull data from NASS 

1. Specify years and pull crop progress data from nass 'SURVEY'

Results: A few states are missing the mature dates, but have harvest dates for barley and oats

For barley: When mature data is not available, use >= 25% harvest date to substitute mature dates
Barley states: "CA" "CO" "ID" "MN" "MT" "OR" "UT" "VA" "WA"

For oats: When mature data is not available, use >= 25% harvest date to substitute mature dates
Oats states: "IA" "IL" "MN" "MT" "NY" "OH" "OR" "TX" "WI"

For corn: When mature data is not available, use >= 7.5% harvest date for mature dates
Corn states: 'MT'

2. Extract the week starting date of at least 50% planted or matured 

Note from the missing results: 

Results: A few states are missing the mature dates, but have harvest dates for barley and oats

For barley: When mature data is not available, use >= 25% harvest date to substitute mature dates
Barley states: "CA" "CO" "ID" "MN" "MT" "OR" "UT" "VA" "WA"

For oats: When mature data is not available, use >= 25% harvest date to substitute mature dates
Oats states: "IA" "IL" "MN" "MT" "NY" "OH" "OR" "TX" "WI"

For corn: When mature data is not available, use >= 7.5% harvest date for mature dates
Corn states: 'MT'

```{r median_date}
#1) calculate the starting date of the week (week starts on Monday)
library(lubridate)

# combine two datasets
crop <- rbind.data.frame(group1,group2)

# convert character to date
crop$week_ending <- as.Date(crop$week_ending)

corn_prog <- crop %>%
  mutate(week_start = floor_date(week_ending, unit = 'week', week_start = 1)) %>%
  group_by(commodity_desc,year,state_alpha,unit_desc) %>%
  filter( 
   # If BARLEY..., keep rows with crop_progress_pct >= 25
    (short_desc == "BARLEY - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED" & 
       (crop_progress_pct >= 25 & crop_progress_pct < 100)) |
   # If OATS..., keep rows with crop_progress_pct >= 25
    (short_desc == "OATS - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED" & 
       (crop_progress_pct >= 25 & crop_progress_pct < 100)) | 
   # If CORN..., keep rows with crop_progress_pct >= 7.5
    (short_desc == "CORN, GRAIN - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED" & 
       (crop_progress_pct >= 7.5 & crop_progress_pct < 100)) |
   # For everything else, keep rows with crop_progress_pct >= 50
    (!short_desc %in% c("BARLEY - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED",
                         "OATS - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED",
                         "CORN, GRAIN - PROGRESS, MEASURED IN PCT HARVESTED") &
       (crop_progress_pct >= 50 & crop_progress_pct < 100)) 
  ) %>%
  slice_min(week_start) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(yday = yday(week_start)) %>%
  select(commodity_desc,year, state_alpha,unit_desc,begin_code,yday,week_start,crop_progress_pct)

```

3. Check for missing values

```{r missing}
# add week start
#corn_prog$week_start <- as.Date(corn_prog$week_start)

corn_prog_wide <- corn_prog %>% 
  select(-c(begin_code,crop_progress_pct,week_start)) %>%
  
  #  Replace all values in a column to "PCT Planted" and "PCT MATURE" 
  mutate(
    unit_desc = case_when(
      unit_desc %in% c("PCT PLANTED", "PCT TRANSPLANTED") ~ "planted",
      TRUE ~ "mature")
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = unit_desc, values_from = yday) 

# read the county list
crop_counties <- read.csv(file = 'data/nass_processed_yield/all_10_crops_county_list_2000_2023.csv')
# Ensure the 'GEOID' column is a string with 5 characters, left-padded with zeros
crop_counties$GEOID <- formatC(crop_counties$GEOID, width = 5, format = 'd' ,flag = '0')

crop_counties_long <- crop_counties %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = 'crop', values_to = 'value', cols = c(BARLEY:WHEAT)) %>%
  filter(value == 1) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(GEOID, value)) %>%
  unique()

# filter crop and states that have yield data
corn_prog_filter <- crop_counties_long %>%
  left_join(corn_prog_wide, by = c('state_alpha', 'crop' = 'commodity_desc'))

test <- corn_prog_filter %>% 
  group_by(crop,state_alpha) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(!is.na(.)), .names = 'non_na_{col}')) %>%
  mutate(non_na = case_when(
    non_na_planted == 0 | non_na_mature == 0 ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ 1
  ))

test %>% filter(non_na == 0)

# A tibble: 4 Ã— 6
# Groups:   crop [3]
#  crop       state_alpha non_na_year non_na_mature non_na_planted non_na
#  <chr>      <chr>             <int>         <int>          <int>  <dbl>
#1 BARLEY     CA                    0             0              0      0
#2 CORN       CA                    0             0              0      0
#3 SUGARBEETS CA                    0             0              0      0
#4 SUGARBEETS NE                    0             0              0      0

```


4. calculate the state average across years

```{r average}
state_avg <- corn_prog_filter %>%
  group_by(crop,state_alpha) %>%
  summarise(planted = mean(planted, na.rm = TRUE),
            mature = mean(mature, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  as.data.frame()

#corn_growing_length <- state_avg %>%
#  filter(crop == 'CORN') %>%
#  mutate(length = mature - planted) %>%
#  summarise(mean_length = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE)) 
#130.4486

#sugarbeets_growing_length <- state_avg %>%
#  filter(crop == 'SUGARBEETS') %>%
#  mutate(length = mature - planted) %>%
#  summarise(mean_length = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE)) 
#172.375

# there are 4 rows with no data at all,
# try to consult the crop caldenar data
  
  # For CA barley,the only barley county in CA is 06079 (San Luis Obispo)
  # use winter barley planted date from the crop calendar data 
  # farmers usually harvest 2-3 weeks or more after maturity
  # so use the harvest date from the crop calendar data minus 21 days
state_avg[2, c('planted','mature')] <- c(6.5, 181 - 21)
 # For CA corn: use planted date from the crop calendar data
state_avg[17, c('planted','mature')] <- c(135,135+130.4)
# For CA sugarbeets: use planted date from the crop calendar data
state_avg[130, c('planted','mature')] <- c(265,(172.4 - (365-265)))
# For NE sugarbeets: use planted date from the crop calendar data
state_avg[137, c('planted','mature')] <- c(108,108+172.4)
  
```

5. Save the crop progress data

```{r save}

saveRDS(state_avg, file = 'data/intermediate_data/Crop_progress_plant_mature.rds')

```
